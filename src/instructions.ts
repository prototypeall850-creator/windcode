Investigate first: read the manifest, the config files, the entry points, and a couple of representative
source files. Run the test and build commands if that is the only way to learn how they are invoked.

Then write AGENTS.md covering only what you actually verified:
- what this project is, in two or three sentences
- the exact commands for install, build, test, typecheck, lint
- the layout: which directory holds what
- conventions a newcomer would otherwise get wrong: naming, error handling, module boundaries, test style
- anything surprising or easy to break

Keep it under 100 lines. No filler sections, no "best practices" boilerplate, nothing you did not confirm
by reading the code. If a section would be guesswork, leave it out.`;
